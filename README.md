Project Title:
Smart Trolley and Automated Checkout System for Seamless Retail Shopping Using Arduino Technology

Project Overview:
This project aims to enhance the traditional retail shopping experience by integrating automation into the item tracking and billing processes using Arduino technology. It introduces a smart trolley equipped with RFID readers, sensors, a billing display unit, and a master verification system, allowing customers to automatically track their selected items and view their bill in real-time. The system minimizes human errors, reduces billing time, and improves customer convenience during checkout.

Objectives:
1. Automate the process of item detection and billing within a shopping trolley.
2. Implement a real-time billing system that updates automatically as items are added or removed.
3. Reduce billing errors by using sensor-based and RFID verification methods.
4. Enhance customer experience by providing a quick, user-friendly checkout system.
5. Demonstrate the practical application of Arduino-based solutions in retail automation.

Hardware Components:
1. Arduino Uno
2. RFID Reader Module
3. RFID Tags
4. LCD Display (16x2 or 20x4)
5. Buzzer
6. Green and Red LEDs
7. Push Button (for bill confirmation)
8. Breadboard and connecting wires
9. Power source

Software and Libraries:
1. Arduino IDE
2. LiquidCrystal Library
3. SoftwareSerial Library
4. RFID Library (if applicable)

Key Features:
1. Automatic detection of items as they are placed in or removed from the trolley.
2. Real-time bill updates displayed on an LCD screen.
3. RFID-based product identification and master card verification.
4. Visual and audio indicators to notify users of item status and actions.
5. Bill verification and final purchase confirmation through a secure process.

Future Enhancements:
1. Integrating a mobile application for digital receipts and purchase tracking.
2. Applying machine learning for customer behavior analysis and personalized suggestions.
3. Adding support for contactless and digital payment options.
4. Real-time inventory management integration.
5. Using energy-efficient hardware components for sustainable operation.
